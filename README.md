  <p align="center">

  <h2 align="center"><a>Overview</a></h2>

  <p align="center">
  Ping-Pong uses the Java Swing library to create a graphical user interface for the game, including the game screen and the paddles and ball on the screen. The GamePanel class uses a game loop to update the game state and redraw the screen, creating the illusion of continuous movement. The game mechanics are simple but effective, allowing players to control their paddles using the arrow keys and score points by hitting the ball past the other player's paddle.
  
 Overall, the project was coded in part of class to practice GUI.
